# Data Pipeline Documentation

This directory contains the logic necessary to generate a realistic, synthetic dataset for the Abu Dhabi ambulance coverage optimization problem.

## Synthetic Data Disclaimer
All datasets generated by this pipeline (zones, demand nodes, candidate stations) are **synthetic**. They have been calibrated using aggregate statistics from the Abu Dhabi Statistics Centre (SCAD) 2023 Yearbook and other public health facility maps. No proprietary or confidential emergency call data was used.

## Components

1. `abu_dhabi_zones.py`: Defines 47 geographic zones across the emirate, including centroids, estimated population, and area.
2. `demand_estimation.py`: Generates demand points proportional to zone population and computes the travel time matrix between stations and demand nodes.
3. `generate_synthetic_data.py`: The orchestration script that runs the full pipeline and saves the results to the `synthetic/` directory.

## Data Calibration
- **Population**: Total emirate population ~3.8M (SCAD 2023).
- **Service Standard**: 8-minute response threshold (HAAD guidelines).
- **Geography**: Projected to **EPSG:32640** (UTM Zone 40N) for metric distance calculations.
