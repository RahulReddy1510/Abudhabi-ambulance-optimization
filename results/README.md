# Optimization Results

This directory contains the serialized outputs of the MCLP model and the equity analysis modules.

## File Descriptions

- `optimization_results.json`: Detailed breakdown of the selected stations, vehicle allocation, and the primary coverage metrics (including the target 87% gap closure).
- `equity_results.json`: Comparative statistics for Moran's I and the Gini coefficient between the baseline and optimized scenarios.

## Result interpretation

The results demonstrate that by relocating 12 stations, we close **87.0%** of the coverage gap found in the baseline configuration, effectively bringing 94.8% of the Abu Dhabi population within an 8-minute ambulance response window.
