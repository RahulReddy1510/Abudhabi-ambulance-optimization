# Literature and Research Notes

## Core Methodology: MCLP
The Maximum Coverage Location Problem (MCLP), first formulated by Church and ReVelle (1974), remains the gold standard for public service siting. Unlike the Location Set Covering Problem (LSCP) which minimizes facilities to cover all nodes, MCLP maximizes coverage given a fixed budget.

## Spatial Autocorrelation: Moran's I
While often used to detect disease clusters or voting patterns, Moran's I is utilized here to detect "Service Bias." A high Moran's I in coverage indicates that high-service zones are unfairly clustered, leaving peripheral areas in "deserts."
